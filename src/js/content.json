    "Code Jam 2022 will be the 2nd-ever iteration of the Code Jam. Our theme is about starting a non-profit: addressing deeply impactful issues and designing creative, unique solutions. We’ve identified five global and technological challenges that we think have tons of potential for innovation. Across each of these challenges, we’ve scaffolded resources like potential project ideas and toolkits, and more to help get you get started. There isn't a strict guideline for what you should work on, but here are some of our focus areas:",
